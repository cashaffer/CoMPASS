Some would know it, but I myself second guessed it, and I'm still not sure if I'm right.	I would ask more about levers...just general stuff.	4

Some of the questions that were asked we haven't gone over the concept of them yet.  Now if we have learned about Simple Machines and Mechanical Adavantage to name a few I'm sure I would of done better on the test.  Some of the diagrams were hard to read.  Like the pully question I couldn't read how heavy the objects were.  But,  some of the questions were worded well.  After being in class for a month I could answer a lot of them.	No, I think they were well chosen.	5

I felt that only about half of the questions were appropriate for a 6th grade classroom.	I think asking children to write out their reasoning for answering questions can be very difficult for children. I found that I was having trouble writing out exactly what my reasoning was. I think it would be better to have writen out responses and ask children which response most closely represents their reasoning.	2

As a sixth grader, most children would only drink soda, which is usually in bottles with twist lids. The only thing that I have seen that needs an opener is alcohol. Even the Coke in glass bottles comes with twist lids now.	you mention both movable and fixed pulleys in question #6, but you don't ever ask a question that would show that the students can differentiate between the forces acting in each system.	3

Maybe if the same catagories of questions were grouped together, more thought could be added to each catagory.  Also some examples for the essay questions would be nice.	I think that given the catagory of simple machines, that most of the questions were appropiate.  Maybe incoporating some questions on gears and wedges would be helpful in order to cover all catagories of simple machines.	5

I was really stumped on several of these questions, and I am a Block B education student, who is getting an empasis in mid-level math.  I hope we learn a lot of these things in this course? 		4

I'm not sure how much 6th graders learn about simple machines, but if these are the questions i hope they have a firm grasp on them. Some of the questions may be a little tricky or challenging for the students to answer. Especially the ones with out pictures, I think children have a clearer image in their head if a picture is provided. I personally was able to better one the questions that had pictures, I am able to understand what the question is really asking.	I dont have any, except maybe some questions that have more to do with everyday activities, such as the seesaw question. This will help kids relate simple machines to things to things we use in everyday life.	4

These are a part of science but science is such a broad topic that it can not be defined into physic questions.

I think it is good for sixth graders to learn this material.  Sometimes some of the questions confused me because of their wording, but I understood after a while what it was asking.	I think that the see-saw exercises would be excellent for elementary schools because a teacher could take them outside for a hands-on-learning session.  Maybe even more about the see saws and pullies.	3

Some of the questions seemed a little hard, but I know it is probably because it was a very long time ago since I was in 6th grade and if the teacher taught about these important concepts, it would be appropriate to test the students over this material.	I don't know the material students learn in 6th grade	5

I think that the question "A student has a good idea of the science behind a question if he or she answers the question correctly." is a very poor question bc its no....any student can guess correctly..they may not know what the answer really was...like how i guessed on alot of these because i really had no idea.	nope	4

The wording of a few questions was a little confusing, but everything was pretty clear.	I don't really know much about this kind of thing, but it seems that a good variety of questions were asked and that it covered the subject material pretty well.	4
