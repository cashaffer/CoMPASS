                Whenever a vertex V is visited during the search, DFS will
                recursively visit all of Vâ€™s unvisited neighbors. Equivalently,
                DFS will add all edges leading out of <i>v</i> to a stack. The
                next vertex to be visited is determined by popping the stack and
                following that edge. The effect is to follow one branch through
                the graph to its conclusion, then it will back up and follow
                another branch, and so on.
