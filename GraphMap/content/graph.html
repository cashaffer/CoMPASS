            <p>A graph G = (V, E) consists of a set of vertices V and a set of 
               edges E, such that each edge in E is a connection between a pair 
               of vertices in V. The number of vertices is written |V|, and the 
               number of edges is written |E|. |E| can range from zero to a
               maximum of |V|<sup>2</sup> - |V|.</p>
